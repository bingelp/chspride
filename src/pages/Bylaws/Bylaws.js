            <hr className="color" />
            <h2>ARTICLE II: BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h2>
            <h3>Section 1. Composition</h3> The Board of Directors (hereinafter
            referred to as “Board”) shall be constituted of fifteen (15)
            members. The Board shall include the following permanent members:
            Chairperson, Vice-chairperson, Treasurer, Secretary, Director of
            Sponsorships, Festival Director, Director of Communications, and
            Director of Outreach. The Board may designate other board members as
            directors of various jurisdictions. The Board may allow some members
            to serve as members-at-large.
            <h3>Section 2. Quorum</h3> In order for any business of CPF to be
            conducted, at least eight (8) members of the Board must be present.
            <h3>Section 3. Qualifications</h3> All Board members must be at
            least eighteen (18) years of age. All Board members must be
            residents of the state of South Carolina and residents of
            Charleston, Berkeley, or Dorchester counties.
            <h3>Section 4. Elections</h3> All members of the Board are elected
            to two year terms on the Board. At the end of a term, a member of
            the Board may stand for re-election. Every member of the Board is
            limited to a maximum of three consecutive terms on the Board. After
            three consecutive terms, a member of the Board may not stand for
            re-election; however, after a period of two years, a previous member
            of the Board may stand for election. A year for purposes of a term
            is congruent calendar year. If the Board desires for a previous
            Board member to return inside of the required two year absence, a
            simple majority vote of the Board may override the provision of the
            required two year absence. <br />
            At the expiration of term of a member of the Board, the member must
            decide whether to stand for re-election if not limited by term
            limits. Upon decision of the member of the Board to stand for
            re-election, the other members of the Board must hold a vote to
            re-election the member of the Board. A simple majority of members of
            the Board present is sufficient to re-elect the member. <br />
            In the event of a vacancy on the Board caused by either a member not
            standing for re-election or a member unable to stand for re-election
            due to term limits, the Chairperson shall appoint a Nomination
            Committee comprised of at least three (3) members of the Board. The
            Vice-Chairperson must be a member of the Nomination Committee. The
            Nomination Committee on behalf of the Board shall advertise the
            opportunity for eligible members of the public to apply for the open
            Board seat. The period for advertising shall be two weeks from the
            date the Chairperson appoints the Nomination Committee. The
            Nomination Committee in consultation with the Board shall establish
            a written application for membership on the Board. Written shall be
            construed liberally to include but not limit the application to an
            electronic version. Advertising shall include a written application
            for membership of the Board, inform all applicants to complete the
            written application, and direct an applicant to submit the
            applicant’s application to the Vice-Chair of the Board. Upon receipt
            of a written application by the Vice-Chair, the Vice-Chair shall
            schedule a time an interview with the applicant and the Nominating
            Committee. All applicants submitting applications shall receive an
            interview with the Nominating Committee. After interviews for all
            applicants have been conducted, the Nominating Committee shall hold
            a vote on each applicant. Each applicant receiving at least a simple
            majority of votes in the Nomination Committee shall be submitted to
            the Board. The Board will conduct a vote. If there is one applicant,
            that applicant shall be awarded membership on the Board. If there
            are two applicants for one available seat on the Board, than a
            simple majority vote of Board members present shall be sufficient to
            elect applicant to the Board. If there are more than two applicants
            for a seat, any applicant receiving a simple majority of votes of
            Board members present shall be awarded membership on the Board. If
            any applicant fails to secure a simple majority of votes of Board
            members present, the applicants receiving the top two amounts of
            votes shall remain on the ballot and all other names removed. Of the
            two remaining applicants, a simple majority of votes of Board
            members present is sufficient to be awarded membership on the Board.
            Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article, any vacancy on
            the Board, as long as there are at least eight (8) members on the
            Board, may be left unfilled on the Board. A simple majority of votes
            of Board members present is sufficient to refuse to select any
            applicant for Board membership. <br />
            The Chair shall appoint the Nominating Committee at the meeting
            following the Annual Pride Event if there is any vacancy on the
            Board. Any elections to the Board shall be held within eight (8)
            weeks of the Annual Pride Event. <br />
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Board may
            recruit new members at any time there is a vacancy.
            <h3>Section 5. Duties of Members of Board</h3> Members of the Board
            shall attend the regularly scheduled meetings of CPF. All members of
            the Board must attend at least six (6) regularly scheduled meetings
            of CPF. All absences must be excused by the Chair. If a member of
            the Board incurs two (2) unexcused absences in a calendar year, the
            member is subject to removal. Physical presence at a meeting may be
            excused at the discretion of the Chair by tele-conference by a
            member of the Board. <br />
            All members of the Board with the exception of members of the
            Executive Committee shall submit bi-weekly written reports to the
            Vice-Chair. “Written reports” shall be construed liberally to
            include but not limited to e-mails, text messages, and other forms
            of electronic communication. <br />
            All members of the Board shall participate in the planning and
            execution of CPF events including but not limited to the Annual
            Pride Event. Special emphasis shall be placed on the Annual Pride
            Event. The inability of a member of the Board to attend the Annual
            Pride Event is grounds for removal from the Board unless by a simple
            majority of other members of the Board approve the member’s reason
            for inability to attend the Annual Pride Event. <br />
            All members of the Board shall be required to personally donate a
            minimum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) to CPF. In lieu of a
            donation by a member of the Board or a business owned by a member of
            the Board, a member of the Board may secure sponsorships, donations,
            or sales of any annual publication of CPF to fulfill the requirement
            of an annual one thousand dollar ($1,000.00) donation to CPF.
            <h3>Section 6. Compensation</h3> No member of the Board will receive
            compensation for duties performed as a member of the Board.
            <h3>Section 7. Removal from the Board</h3> Any member of the Board
            may resign by submitting a written resignation to the Chair at any
            time. “Written resignation” shall be construed liberally to include
            but not limited to a signed letter, e-mail, or electronic message.
            However, a text message is insufficient to resign for the Board.
            Upon receipt by the Chair, the resignation is effective immediately.
            <br />
            Any member of the Board that fails to perform any duties listed in
            Article II Section 5 is subject to removal from the Board after
            notice of and completion of a removal hearing. The removal
            proceeding shall be initiated by a three-fourths vote of the
            Executive Committee. Any member subject to removal shall be notified
            by written letter signed by the Chair and sent via certified mail
            with return receipt requested by the United States Postal Service.
            The letter must include the grounds for removal and notification of
            the date, time, and location of the removal hearing. The removal
            hearing must not be held less than ten (10) days or more than twenty
            (20) days from the date the letter was sent to the member of the
            Board subject to removal. All other members of the Board shall be
            notified of the date, time, and location of the removal hearing via
            e-mail at their official CPF e-mail address. <br />
            The removal hearing shall be presided over by the Chairperson or in
            the case that the Chairperson is subject to removal the
            Vice-Chairperson shall preside over the removal hearing. At the
            removal hearing, the presiding officer shall present the grounds for
            removal. The member subject to removal shall be given an opportunity
            to present a defense in writing or orally to the other members of
            the Board. At the hearing, a three-fourths vote of the members of
            the Board not subject to removal who are present is necessary to
            remove the member.

            not limited to a signed letter, e-mail, or electronic message.
            However, a text message is insufficient to resign from an office

            <h2>ARTICLE IV: MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
            <h3>Section 1. Meeting Schedule</h3> The Board shall meet at least
            once a month at a time, place, and date set by the Chairperson. All

            of a monthly meeting. The meeting following the Annual Pride Event

            three (3) days of receipt of the written requests by the
            Chairperson. “Written request” shall be construed liberally to
            include but not limited to a signed letter, e-mail, or electronic
            message. However, a text message is insufficient to request a
            special meeting.
            <h3>Section 2. Votes Required.</h3> In addition to any votes
            required as outlined in Article II and Article III, the Board must

            members present is needed to create and execute events for CPF and
            associate CPF with any event or organization. <br />
            In order to amend the bylaws of CPF, a member of the Board must
            propose the amendment in writing to every other Board member. The
            Board will debate the amendment at the Board meeting following the
            Board meeting after the amendment is proposed. A two-thirds vote of
            Board members present is necessary to pass an amendment to the CPF
            bylaws. “Written amendment” shall be construed liberally to include
            but not limited to a signed letter, e-mail, or electronic message.
            However, a text message is insufficient to propose a written
            amendment. <br />
            In order to dissolve CPF, notwithstanding the provision in Article
            II Section 2, at least twelve (12) members of the Board must be
            present in order to debate and vote on dissolving CPF. A member of
            the Board must motion for dissolution in writing to every other

            on at the Board meeting following the Board meeting after the
            amendment is proposed. It requires a unanimous vote of all Board
            members present to dissolve CPF. “Motion for Dissolution” shall be
            construed liberally to include but not limited to a signed letter,
            e-mail, or electronic message. However, a text message is
            insufficient to make a motion for dissolution. <br />
            At any time in which there is a tie in voting, the issue shall be
            subject to additional discussion for a time period not to exceed
            fifteen (15) minutes and followed by another vote. If the subsequent
            vote results in a tie, the issue shall be decided by the
            Chairperson’s vote.
